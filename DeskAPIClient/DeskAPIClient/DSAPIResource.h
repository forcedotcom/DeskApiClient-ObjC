/* A note on KVC Support for `DSAPIResource`s
 *
 * Any of the properties above can be accessed using KVC, e.g. `[resource valueForKey:@"linkToSelf"]`
 * Additionally, you can access the resource's underlying API fields using KVC as follows:
 * `[caseResource valueForKey:@"subject"]`, or even `[caseResource valueForKey:@"_links"]`.
 *
 * A special note on accessing the `links` property above, vs. the `_links` key: the former (`links`)
 * will return a dictionary in which each link relation points to an array of links. This is in order
 * to match the HAL spec (http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) while retaining type information.
 * The HAL spec states that link relations may point to single or multiple links. If a link relation
 * points to a single link, you will get an array with one object for the given link relation in `links`.
 
 * The latter (`_links`) will return the representation sent by the API, in which link relations that
 * point to a single link will return a dictionary representing that link, rather than an array. In the
 * API, arrays are only used for link relations that point to more than one link.
 *
 * You can also use subscripting to access the underlying API fields, as in:
 * `resource[@"subject"]`
